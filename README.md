# GraphConnectivityTester
This project aims to use the most efficient algorithms to find whether an undirected graph, or a directed graph is strongly connected. That is, one can move from any vertex of the graph to any other, following the edges as paths.
## Algorithms Considered
For undirected graphs:
* Union-Find Algorithm (optimized) â€“ Not used, yet implemented
  * Complexity: O(n^2 log n)
* BFS Algorithm
  * Complexity: O(n^2)

For directed graphs:
* Kosaraju's Algorithm
  * Complexity: O(n^2)

## About the project
This project was solely developed by myself, Daniel Lopez, as a project for a CMPSC 360 class, taught at Penn State Behrend by Professor Naseem Ibrahim.
